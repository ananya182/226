## AST DATATYPE DEFINITION

**Program** = PROG of IDEN * Block

**Type** = INT, BOOL

**Block** = BLK of DeclarationSequence * CommandSequence

**Exp** = IEXP of int , BEXP of bool , BINEXP of BinaryOp * Exp * Exp , UNEXP of UnaryOp * Exp , CONDEXP of RelOp * Exp * Exp

**Declaration** = DECL of Variable * VariableList * Type

**DeclarationSequence** = DECLSEQ1 of Declaration, DECLSEQ2 of Declaration * DeclarationSequence

**CommandSequence** = CMDSEQ1 of Command, CMDSEQ2 of Command*CommandSequence

**VariableList** = VARLIST1 of Variable, VARLIST2 of Variable*VariableList

**Command** = SET of Variable * Exp , ITE of Exp * CommandSequence * CommandSequence , WH of Exp * CommandSequence 

**UnaryOp** = NOT , NEG

**BinaryOp** = PLUS , MINUS , TIMES , DIV , MOD , AND , OR

**RelOp** = EQ of Exp * Exp , NEQ of Exp * Exp , LT of Exp * Exp , LEQ of Exp * Exp , GT of Exp * Exp , GEQ of Exp * Exp

**Variable** = VAR of IDEN

## FunStack IMPLEMENTATION

Implemented a general-purpose functional stack structure as mentioned in the assignment with all required Stack functions.

## Memory M

Allocated space for variables as an Array.array

## Vmc structure

I have defined type VMC = 'a Stack * Array.array * 'a Stack

## Semantic Rules

Implemented semantic rules using the function rules which takes VMC as input (one configuration) and using pattern matching applies the relevant semantic rule (using stack operations) to output a VMC configuration.

## postfix function

This is a recursive function which returns postfix of a program (as a' list) given as input in the form of an AST.

## execute function

execute function takes postfix of a program as list as input and outputs a VMC (final configuration). It calls a function f, which recursively calls itself after application of rules on the current VMC configuration.
